# Goals
1. Gain access to user1/2 account (2 possible routes)

2. Gain access to admin account (1 possible route)

3. Remote Shell (3 possible routes)


Try to find every way, and create a python script which

automates the entire process from an unauthenticated user to a remote shell.


The attack for step 2 may take up to a minute to complete, since the admin's actions

are emulated that often on the virtual machine.

# Credentials
## Web App
* admin:admin
* user1:user1
* user2:user2

## Virtual Machine
tudo:tudo (sudo)

# How to begin?
Install VMPlayer, and import the supplied box as an existing virtual machine. Make sure

you can open up the website in the browser, and then you should be ready to tackle the goals.

Virtual machine:

Good luck :)
